# 3-led-with-3-buttons
This Arduino project allows the user to control three LEDs using three push buttons.  
Each button turns on its corresponding LED for 5 seconds, then turns it off automatically.

## Components Used
- Arduino UNO  
- 3 LEDs  
- 3 Push Buttons  
- 3 Resistors (220Î© for LEDs)  
- 3 Resistors (10kÎ© pull-down for buttons)  
- Breadboard + Jumper wires  

## Pin Configuration
| Button   | Arduino Pin | LED   | Arduino Pin |
|----------|--------------|-------|--------------|
| Button 1 | D2           | LED 1 | D10          |
| Button 2 | D3           | LED 2 | D11          |
| Button 3 | D4           | LED 3 | D12          |

## ðŸ§  How it works
- When a button is pressed, the matching LED turns on.  
- It stays on for 5 seconds using delay(5000).  
- Then the LED automatically turns off.
